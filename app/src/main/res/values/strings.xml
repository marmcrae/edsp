        Spells, like prayer and mantras, allow us to tap into the limitless power of the conscious energy
        that lies within and around all of us. By understanding our powerful human ability to harness this
        energy, you will be able to create real magic in your life. I truly believe that used properly these
        spells can help provide you with the tools you need to greatly enhance your everyday life in both small
        and profound ways.
        \n
        \nA few words of wisdom, the outcome of your spells is directly tied to your energy. As long as you project
        strong energy and an unwavering belief that the spell will work, you should yield good results. Likewise,
        if you are apprehensive, harbour guilt or anxiety (sometimes because of religious indoctrination), or have low vibrational
        energy than the results may not come as quickly or as strongly as they would if approached from
        a stronger energetic space. Furthermore, although love spells are included in this application understand that
        any spell that is directed towards someone else and influences their freewill or negatively affects their well being
        WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES. What you do comes back to you. Karmic energy is real and I implore that you do not take it lightly.
        \n
        \n
        All the best to you and your journey!
